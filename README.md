# NotesScripting
Will try to create some python scripts that will automatically be ran on certains times during days I have classes, where markdown files will be created for every class and uploaded to my s3 bucket where I can view the notes on my personal website through their APIs 


### Some functionalities:

- script runs when i have my laptop open during my first class of the day
- Create a new directory on bishal/notes/auto 
  - number of files should be the number of classes I have for the day
    - name of the files should be data+class.md ex. Jan26CSE3380.md
- after the last class the files will be uploaded to my s3 bucket
